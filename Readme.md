# NSHG 2023 Mendelian Randomization Workshop

The workshop material is currently being added to this repository!

We encourage you to clone (or download) this repository and open the `Rproj`
file in Rstudio. Then run the code in `./analysis/step_0_prepwork.R`.

**This ensures the following:**

1) That you have all the require packages installed
2) That you can download the sumstats (4 Gb) ahead of time
