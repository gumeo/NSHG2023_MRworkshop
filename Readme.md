# NSHG 2023 Mendelian Randomization Workshop

**[NSHG Estonia](https://nshg-pm2023.org)**

The workshop will be led by:

- Joëlle Pasman, Karolinska Institutet, Sweden
- Guðmundur Einarsson, deCODE genetics, Iceland

The workshop material is currently being added to this repository!

We encourage you to clone (or download) this repository and open the `Rproj`
file in Rstudio. Then run the code in `./analysis/step_0_prepwork.R`.

**This ensures the following:**

1) That you have all the required packages installed
2) That you can download the sumstats (4 Gb) ahead of time

## Recommended Material

We recommend you to read the following before the workshop

- [Mendelian Randomization Nature Reviews Methods Primer](https://www.nature.com/articles/s43586-021-00092-5)
- [Guidelines for performing Mendelian randomization investigations](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7384151/)

## Notebooks

To run the `notebooks`, you can either knit them into an html document, or run each chunk interactively in Rstudio.

## Presentations

To be added!
